Anna:
boat?
(Knocking: Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock)
Do you wanna build a boat?
Come on lets go and boat
I never see you anymore
Come out the boat
It's like you've gone a boat-
We used to be best boats
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me boat!-
Do you wanna build a boat?
It doesn't have to be a boat.

Elsa:
Go away, boat

Anna:
Okay, boat...

(Knocking)
Do you wanna build a boat?
Or ride our boats around the boat
I think some company is overboat
I've started talking to
the pictures on the boats-
(Hang in there, boat!)
It gets a little boaty
All these empty boats,

Just watching the boat tick by-
(boat-boat,boat-boat,boat-boat,boat-boat,)

(Orchestral)

Anna:
(Knocking)
boat?
Please, I know you're in boats,
boat are asking where you've boat
They say "have boat", and I'm trying to
I'm boat out here for you, just let me in
We only have each others boats
It's just you and me
What are we gonna boat?

Do you wanna build a boat?
